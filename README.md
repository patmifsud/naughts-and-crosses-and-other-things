# Naughts and Crosses and Other things

A simple checkers/ tik tac to game I made as part of my GA Cs course. 
It allows you to choose a board size between 3x3 and 9x9, up to 4 players and supports a few different win conditions.

It works on mobile, too, but I haven't tested it too throughly yet. 

It's writen in javascript, html and css.
